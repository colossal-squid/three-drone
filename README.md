# a quadcopter you could fly, in three.js

This repo is me experimenting with physics engines, three js, browser USB gamepads support and so on. All in year of our lord baby jesus 2022.

People kept bumping into this on google and asked questions - here's the source. Hope it helps.

[Playable version built on Jan 13th 2022](https://three-drone.netlify.app/)

_Keep in mind: I've been not using keyboard to control the drone in either video. Controls were written for [Betafpv LiteRadio 2 SE Radio Transmitter](https://betafpv.com/products/literadio-2-se-radio-transmitter). Maybe normal gamepad also can work adequate, but with keyboard it surely won't be controllable (not without additional tweaks)_

## Building it and running locally

`npm install`

`npm start`

## My extensive video demonstrating earlier version (it's in GIT history too, just reset HEAD a few commits back)
